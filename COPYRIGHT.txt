These materials represent a further development of the concepts introduced in the following early-stage publication:

**“Automated Warehouse Layout Design: A Software Application”**  
Published: April 2025  
DOI: [10.13140/RG.2.2.33177.12642](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.33177.12642)

That publication may be referenced for foundational ideas and basic layout design approaches. However, the interactive components, HTML/JavaScript visualizations, and other content in this repository reflect ongoing work and more advanced features that have not yet been formally published.
