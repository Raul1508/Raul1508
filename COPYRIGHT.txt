This repository includes interactive components, images, and unpublished source materials — including but not limited to HTML, JavaScript, 3D visualizations, and original illustrations or photographs — which represent a further development of my research work.

These materials extend the concepts introduced in:

That publication may be cited for foundational concepts and basic layout designs.  
However, the content of this repository — including images — represents more advanced, unpublished work.
