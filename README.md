# Hello there! I'm RAUL FERNANDEZ.

I'm a dedicated researcher and engineer operating at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence, Optimization, and Systems Engineering**. My expertise lies in architecting **hybrid intelligent frameworks** that combine machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, and natural language processing to automate and optimize complex design processes.

### 🧠 Current Focus & Research
- **LAYNEX Framework:** Use of NLP for generative warehouse layout design and 3D spatial optimization.
- **Hybrid AI Models:** Building systems that integrate symbolic AI (constraint handling) with neural networks for more robust and interpretable automation.
- **Greenfield Software Development:** Creating intelligent tools from the ground up, like the **Hybrid Intelligent System** project for warehouse management.
- **Software Prototyping:** I develop intelligent software from the ground up, such as the Integrated Storage Allocation Framework (ISAF) for evaluating warehouse storage strategies.

### 🎯 My Mission
My long-term goal is to contribute to the next generation of intelligent logistics systems. I am passionate about creating AI that is not only theoretically advanced but also practical and capable of delivering tangible value in supply chain management.

*💡 I am actively seeking PhD opportunities and collaborations to advance this research further. Contact me and reach me out at:*
