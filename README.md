# Hello there! I'm Raúl Fernández.

A curious developer and researcher passionate about the fundamental nature of operational systems. My work sits at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence, Operations Research, and Systems Engineering**, where I explore a simple, driving question: **Can we discover a more organic, integrated logic for how warehouses and supply chains function?**

I develop hybrid frameworks—combining machine learning tecniques, and constraint optimization (heuristics) — not just as ends in themselves, but as experimental tools to probe these deeper questions. My goal is to move beyond siloed optimizations and towards a holistic understanding of spatial and logistical interdependence.

## 🧠 Research Focus & Exploring Big Questions

My work is an ongoing exploration to bridge theoretical concepts with tangible applications. I build software prototypes to test hypotheses and visualize complex relationships that are often only described in theory.

I am particularly fascinated by questions like:
*   What does a **truly integrated design paradigm** look like, where layout, allocation, and operational logic co-evolve from the outset, rather than being optimized sequentially?
*   How can we move from static, one-size-fits-all models to **adaptive, "living" systems** that can reorganize based on real-time flow and demand signals?
*   Can we define a **unifying theoretical framework** that elegantly captures the complex trade-offs between space, time, energy, and resilience in logistics?

My current projects, including generative layout algorithms and intelligent storage frameworks, are my first steps in experimenting with these ideas. They are a practical sandbox for exploring these more profound philosophical questions about operations.

## 🎯 My Path Forward: Seeking Collaboration & Guidance

I am actively seeking a **PhD position** to deepen this inquiry. I am not just looking for a program, but for a collaborative partnership with mentors who are also excited by these fundamental challenges. I want to contribute to foundational knowledge while ensuring the research has a clear pathway to real-world impact, potentially through future integration with enterprise ecosystems (ERP, WMS, SCaaS).

> **For Researchers & Professors:** My work is a starting point for discussion, not a finished product. I have built interactive demos and drafted initial formulations to make these abstract concepts tangible. I would be thrilled to share my progress and hear your perspective on how we could explore these questions together.

## 🧠 Research Focus & Expertise

My work is centered on the end-to-end automation of warehouse design and management. I develop full-stack software prototypes to validate research concepts through simulation and interactive visualization.

*   **Generative Warehouse Design:** Creating novel algorithms for the automated generation and optimization of 3D warehouse layouts based on operational constraints and efficiency metrics.
*   **Hybrid Intelligent Systems:** Building systems that integrate the exploratory power of **Genetic Algorithms (GAs)** with other AI paradigms for robust, multi-objective optimization.
*   **Research Software Prototyping:** Translating theoretical models into functional, scalable software tools—from core optimization engines to interactive GUI applications—to demonstrate practical value and validate research hypotheses.

## 🎯 Mission

I am actively seeking a **PhD position** to advance this research under expert supervision. My goal is to contribute foundational work to the field of automated logistics, creating AI-driven solutions that are both theoretically rigorous and capable of delivering significant real-world impact.

> **For Researchers & Professors:** My complete research portfolio, including detailed formulations, comparative analysis results, and publication drafts, is available upon request. I am eager to discuss how my research direction and technical execution could contribute to your lab's projects.
