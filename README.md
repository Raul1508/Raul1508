# Hello there! I'm Raúl Fernández.

A curious developer and researcher exploring the fundamental principles of operational systems. My work sits at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence, Operations Research, and Systems Engineering**, driven by a central question:

**Can we discover a more organic, integrated logic for how warehouses and supply chains function?**

I develop computational prototypes and hybrid frameworks (using techniques like Genetic Algorithms and constraint optimization) as experimental tools to probe these questions, moving beyond siloed optimizations towards a holistic understanding of spatial and logistical interdependence.

## 🧠 Research Focus & Key Questions

My work is an exploration to bridge theoretical concepts with practical applications. I build software to test hypotheses about system design.

I am fascinated by questions like:
*   What does a **truly integrated design paradigm** look like, where layout, allocation, and operational logic co-evolve from the outset?
*   How can we create **adaptive, "living" systems** that reorganize based on real-time flow and demand?
*   Can we define a **unifying theoretical framework** that captures the complex trade-offs between space, time, and resilience in logistics?

My projects in generative layout algorithms and intelligent storage are practical sandboxes for exploring these deeper philosophical questions about operations.

## 🎯 Seeking PhD Collaboration

I am actively seeking a **PhD position** to deepen this inquiry under expert guidance. I am looking for a collaborative partnership with mentors who are excited by fundamental challenges in optimization and systems design.

> **For Researchers & Professors:** The demos above are a conceptual preview. The full details of my methods, algorithmic innovations, and results are available for discussion. I would be thrilled to share more about my work and how it could align with your research group.
