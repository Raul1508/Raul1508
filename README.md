# Hello there! I'm Raúl Fernández.

A research engineer and developer pioneering the next generation of intelligent logistics systems. I operate at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence, Operations Research, and Systems Engineering**, architecting hybrid frameworks that combine machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, and constraint optimization to solve complex spatial and logistical problems.

## 🧠 Research Focus & Expertise

My work is centered on the end-to-end automation of warehouse design and management. I develop full-stack software prototypes to validate research concepts through simulation and interactive visualization.

*   **Generative Warehouse Design:** Creating novel algorithms for the automated generation and optimization of 3D warehouse layouts based on operational constraints and efficiency metrics.
*   **Hybrid Intelligent Systems:** Building systems that integrate the exploratory power of **Genetic Algorithms (GAs)** with other AI paradigms for robust, multi-objective optimization.
*   **Research Software Prototyping:** Translating theoretical models into functional, scalable software tools—from core optimization engines to interactive GUI applications—to demonstrate practical value and validate research hypotheses.

## 🎯 Mission

I am actively seeking a **PhD position** to advance this research under expert supervision. My goal is to contribute foundational work to the field of automated logistics, creating AI-driven solutions that are both theoretically rigorous and capable of delivering significant real-world impact.

> **For Researchers & Professors:** My complete research portfolio, including detailed formulations, comparative analysis results, and publication drafts, is available upon request. I am eager to discuss how my research direction and technical execution could contribute to your lab's projects.
