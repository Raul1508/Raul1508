# Hello there! I'm RAUL FERNANDEZ.

I'm a dedicated researcher and engineer operating at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence, Optimization, and Systems Engineering**. My expertise lies in architecting **hybrid intelligent frameworks** that combine machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, and natural language processing to automate and optimize complex design processes.

### 🧠 Current Focus & Research
- **LAYNEX Framework:** Use of NLP for generative warehouse layout design and 3D spatial optimization.
- **Hybrid AI Models:** Building systems that integrate symbolic AI (constraint handling) with neural networks for more robust and interpretable automation.
- **Greenfield Software Development:** Creating intelligent tools from the ground up, like the **Hybrid Intelligent System** project for warehouse management.

### 🎯 My Mission
My long-term goal is to **lead and collaborate with visionary teams** to build foundational intelligent systems. I believe in creating AI that is not only powerful but also practical, accessible, and capable of solving real-world problems in logistics, supply chain, and beyond.

*💡 Interested in intelligent systems, computational design, or AI research? I'm always open to discussing collaboration and new ideas.*
